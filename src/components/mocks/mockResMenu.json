These melt-in-the-mouth choles are mildly spiced. One can taste the myriad spices which explode in the mouth, unlike in other joints, where one only get's to taste green chillies and ginger.  Combination of the garam masala which renders it's  unique taste, is a play of spices, which is grounded in house. The same recipe, without any tweaks, is being followed day in and day out, traditionalism coupled with no compromise on quality, is the secret behind their success. ",
